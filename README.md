# Meme Generator

The **Meme Generator** app is built using React and focuses on enhancing my skills in React development. It utilizes the useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and fetches meme data from an external API. The app allows users to enter desired text for the top and bottom sections of the meme, and dynamically generates custom memes based on user input. It provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for meme creation and encourages creativity through meme customization.
